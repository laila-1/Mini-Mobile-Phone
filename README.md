# Mini-Mobile-Phone
I made a mini functioning mobile phone using html, css, and js!
This was a collection of things I learnt how to do from the jams and workshops, and it was a lot of fun learning and experimenting!!
This is the first like big project I did with web development and I'm kind of proud of myself lol

also : If ur curious why only the js code for the recording app is in the script.js file, its bc for some reason the js codes for the other apps wouldn't work unless in the <script> tags lol
