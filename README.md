# Mini-Mobile-Phone
I made a mini functioning mobile phone using html, css, and js!
This was a collection of things I learnt how to do from the jams and workshops, and it was a lot of fun learning and experimenting!!
This is the first like big project I did with web development and I'm kind of proud of myself lol
